# Day 16

It's [Dart](https://dart.dev/) day today. If you've never heard of Dart before, it's the language used
for Google's [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework, which I've used in the past before for some
small projects.

Overall, not hard to work with, it's pretty similiar to JS. Fun day overall as well - this was
effectively writing a convoluted Polish Notation calculator.

To run, install dart, and in this directory:

```bash
dart day_16.dart
```

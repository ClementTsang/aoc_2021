# Day 7

Decided to play with [GNU Smalltalk](https://www.gnu.org/software/smalltalk/) today - I've used this before for a course
(CS 442: Principles of Programming Languages course keeps on giving).

However, today's code barely uses the properties of the language, since it's so straightforward and just a couple of
calculations - oh well.

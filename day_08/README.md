# Day 8

Today's AoC is a trip down memory lane to the first programming language I ever learned,
and one that most people probably haven't heard of (unless you're Canadian and took CS in high school) - [Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(programming_language))!

This is the language that somehow got me interested in CS and programming in the first place, so
despite all its warts, the lack of support after the company developing it went out of business, and the fact
that I haven't written Turing in nearly 8+ years, I still have fond memories of it.

Fond memories aside, this one was a pain - there are a huge lack of language features that are common nowadays, and the editor kept crashing on my Win11 machine if I either undoed too much, copy pasted too much, or just used it for a while. At least it's nice enough to automatically save your work if it crashes.

To run this, you need to download [Turing](http://compsci.ca/holtsoft/) - note this only works on Windows.

From there, you can open the file in the Turing editor and just run it.

Alternatively, install [OpenTuring](http://tristan.hume.ca/openturing/) - this also apparently works on Wine for non-Windows systems, though I haven't tried it.

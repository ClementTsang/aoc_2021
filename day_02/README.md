# Day 2

My sole experience with Prolog is like one module I took talking about it in the study of programming languages... yeah,
feast your eyes on some of the most cursed Prolog code if you dare read this.

To run (I used SWI-Prolog), for `part_1.pl`:

```bash
# In shell
./part_1.pl
```

```prolog
% In interpreter
?- main.
Position: 1980
Depth: 951
Answer: 1882980
true .
```

For `part_2.pl`:

```bash
# In shell
./part_2.pl
```

```prolog
% In interpreter
?- main.
Position: 1980
Depth: 995572
Accuracy: 951
Answer: 1971232560
true .
```

Ensure `input.txt` is in the same directory as the `.pl` files (it's hard-coded in).

# Day 4

Today's AoC is done in F#.

This one was a bit less of a jump into the abyss - while I've never used F# before, I _have_ used OCaml quite a bit for
school. Still a bit tricky though - fully functional is always a bit of a paradigm switch.

To run, you'll need `dotnet` installed. In this directory:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/day_4/day_4.fsproj
```

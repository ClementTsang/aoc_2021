# Day 18

I decided to go with [Go](https://go.dev/) today. I've used this before, though not amazingly and not recently.

---

To run, install Go, and in this directory:

```bash
go run day_18.go input.txt
```

If you don't specify a relative file path, it will default to `input.txt`:

```bash
go run day_18.go
```

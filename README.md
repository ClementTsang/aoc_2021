# aoc_2021

Personal AoC 2021 work, feel free to reference if you don't mind the jank.

Going to try to use a different language every day (assuming I can stick around for all days) as a bit of a challenge.

Note that for most, if not all days, _none of the code is going to be great_ - I'm using this as a learning experience
for a lot of the languages (for many it will be my very first time using them), and my goal is just getting to the
solutions, so it will only be as clean, idiomatic, and efficient as I need it to be to do so.

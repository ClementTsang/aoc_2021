# Day 14

Today's language of choice is [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) - and this is a language I've had
some fun with in the past due to CS 135, the first CS course that most CS students take at UW. I have
some, uh, "fond" memories of hand-writing Racket code during exams and praying that I counted the
brackets right.

This was a fun day today too! I spent a bit long writing the first part (mostly just getting my
bearings with Racket features I've never used before like hashmaps, as well as having not had
any reason to use this language for almost 4 years...), but once Part 1 was done, it immediately
worked for Part 2, which was nice.

To run, install Racket. Then either run it on DrRacket, or run using:

```bash
racket day_14.rkt
```

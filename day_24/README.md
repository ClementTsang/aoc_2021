# Day 24

Today is Kotlin day. I find I like it a lot more than normal Java.

---

To run, I used Intellij and just ran the project. You could use `kotlinc` but that's a bit more work.

You can configure this project to run a specific file in the configuration by passing it in as the first flag; if no
flags are passed, it defaults to `input.txt`.

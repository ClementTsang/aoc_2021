# Day 3

Today's attempt is in Haskell. Again, my only exposure to Haskell is learning about the language design in a course,
so this was fun.

This is NOT good code, btw - it does repeated reads in part 1 because I was too lazy, for example.

To run this, use:

```bash
ghc -dynamic day_3.hs
./day_3
```

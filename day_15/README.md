# Day 15

Today's Zig day! Been interested in trying this language, and it's pretty interesting. There are
some things I found confusing at first (the lack of a simple for-range-loop is incredibly weird
to me, for example), but otherwise, there's a lot to like!

---

To run, install zig, and in this directory:

```bash
zig build-exe day_15.zig
./day_15
```

# Day 9

Today's submission is in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/). I have some experience with this for writing
some simple scripting files for CS 488 (Graphics), but that's really it.

A nice upgrade from day 8 to say the least, while Lua lacks some built-in features for various
reasons, it's leagues better than working with Turing again, and using it today was fairly easy.

To run in this directory, assuming you have Lua installed:

```bash
lua day_9.lua input.txt
```

If you don't specify the file input, it will default to `input.txt`.
